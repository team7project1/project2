# CS4310 Project 02 - *"Wait", don't "kill" it...*

Team members: **Thomas Pickering, Nhat Tran, Celine Mangahas**

## Purpose

Understand the structure of FreeNOS (API, system calls, traps).

“Git” ready.

Get debugging skills.

## Task Description

### Part 1: Git

* [x] Follow this [guide](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners), and make your FreeNOS-1.0.3 Folder a git repo, make its remote repo (“origin”) a new repo in your GitHub account.
* [x] Make and check out a branch named “wait”. You will be working on this branch for this project.
* [x] Add GitHub user: “2404s21” as a collaborator.

### Part 2: Write an application named “wait” in folder “FreeNOS-1.0.3\bin\wait”

* [ ] It should work similarly to the wait command that comes with Ubuntu. (In your terminal, do “man wait” to learn more.) It should be able to wait for a background process (e.g. “sleep 30 &”) to finish and return.
* [ ] It should follow the application code structure like the “sleep” command of FreeNOS.

### Part 3: Record a 3-minute (approx..) screencast with your voice (facial image is optional but encouraged)

* [ ] Introduce yourselves;
* [ ] Demo kill a process or two;
* [ ] Show off your contribution to FreeNOS: what you did to get rid of the bug? What debugger did you use?
